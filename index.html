    <h1>The Atlantic Salmon</h1>
    <p>
      The Atlantic Salmon (<i>Salmo salar</i>) is a part of the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salmonidae">Salmonidae</a> family
      and can grow up to a meter in length. Atlantic Salmon have their name due
      to the fact they are found in the northern Atlantic Ocean. There are four
      life stages of the
      <abbr title="Salmo salar">S. salar</abbr> :<i>Alevin</i>, <i>Fry</i>,
      <i>Parr</i> and <i>Smolt</i>

    <h2>Spawning</h2>
    <p>
      Atlantic Salmon begin their lifecycle by hatching in streams or rivers
      then gradually move out to sea once matured. When the salmon turn into
      adults they will return to the same location in the river or stream in
      which they were born in to spawn. The Atlantic Salmon is
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semelparity_and_iteroparity"
        >iteroparous</a
      >, which means unlike other species of salmon it will travel back to the
      sea and return to the river in a years time to spawn again.
    </p>
    <aside>
      <h3>Landlocked Salmon</h3>
      There is a small population of the Atlantic Salmon that only migrate to
      large lakes rather than the ocean. These fish are called "landlocked"
      Salmon.
    </aside>
    <h2>Fishing</h2>
    <p>
      The Atlantic Salmon is very healthy to eat and happens to be very tasty
      therefore making it a very sought after fish.
      <q cite="https://www.selinawamucii.com/insights/prices/canada/salmon/">
        In 2023 the approximate price range for Canadian Salmon is between $5.13
        and $5.37 per pound(lb).
      </q>
      Many people used to recreationally and commecially fish for Atlantic
      Salmon. However this has resulted in the species becoming endangered
      therefore most Atlantic Salmon found in the supermarket today are from
      aquaculture farms.
